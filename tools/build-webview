# tools/build-webview: WebView assets collection script.
#
# This script collates and constructs WebView assets into a staging directory,
# then copies that staging directory to a build-system-provided destination.
#
# The former task is largely the responsibility of auxiliary build scripts. The
# latter is accomplished via rsync.

# CAVEAT EMENDATOR: Neither of the build systems have any visibility into this
# script's dependencies -- it is run unconditionally, and must ensure on its own
# that it performs as few actions as possible when nothing has changed.
